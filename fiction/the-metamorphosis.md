## Summary

Gregor Samsa wakes up not as a human but something else like an insect, a bug, a monstorous one. He works as a travelling salesperson, to repay his parent's debts. He is a good and hard working person. Instead of contemplating how he came into this kind of situation, he is worrying about being late to work. He struggles for hours to get out of bed until when the genral manager of the company he is working shows up at the door. The general manager is ruthless, he falsly accuses Gregor's work ethics in front of his parents who try to defend his innocense. Gregor is locked in his room when all of this is happening, others keep asking him to open the door which he does when the general manager is brutally persistant. All are shocked when they see Gregor in his current form, the general manager flees but Gregor is seen convincing him that he'll be back to work somehow only for his father to shove him back into the room. His sister seems to take good care of Gregor, serving him his favourite milk and cleaning the room. Although he disliked food, couldn't consume any of it and hid himself beneath the settee whenever anyone entered his room. Nobody in the family wanted to remain home alone and leaving the house unattended was out of the question while Gregor had many sleepless hungry nights but his only concern had been to remedy the state of utter hopelesness brought to the family as he was the only financial provider for the family and he secretly planned to send his sister to the conservatory the next year.

### Alienation

"For two days, every mealtime was spent deliberating how the family should now comport itself; but even between the meals this same discussion continued, for at least two members of the household were present at all times, since apparently no one wanted to reamin at home alone, and of course leaving the appartment unattended was out of the question."

### Isolation

"In order to spare her even this sight, one day he carried the bedsheet over to the settee on his back this labor cost him four hours and arranged it in such a way that he was now completely covered, so that his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down"
